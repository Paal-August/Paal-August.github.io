We are setting up a new alternative investment fund in the renewable energy sector.
The fund will start with investments in infrastructure like solar producing plants
and landbased windmill plants. When 70 % of committed capital is invested, we will
on a smaller scale invest in technology companies that is based on renewable energy
and has the potential to disrupt the transportation sector as we know it. Example of
new technology is better batteries and autonom vihicles (cars, boats, aerial).
